    <h1>Getting a Root Shell on Router via UART</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">"There was a time in the not-so-distant past
        when hardware was relegated to the fringes
        of hacking [...]"</p>
    <p>For many, accessing a router via UART is extremely trivial; however, it can still be quite
        enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a way, obtaining a shell via the UART protocol is simple. Difficulties
        may arise in embedded systems that have a locked shell or other protection mechanisms. With that in mind, I will try to be as explanatory as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the router I will be exploring:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/roteador.png"> I took this photo from the Internet because I didn't know where its case was.
    </div>
    <p class="topic"><strong>Analog Signal vs. Digital Signal</strong></p>
    <p>
        I do not intend to delve too deeply into electronics in this topic, but there are some concepts we need to know before performing this attack.
        It is essential that we understand what an analog signal is, what a digital signal is, and eventually understand their differences.
    </p>
    <p class="subtopic"><strong>Analog Signal</strong></p>
    <p>
        An analog signal can have infinite values at a given time. This graph represents the waves of an analog signal:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/onda_analogica.png"> 
        <span class="link"><a href="https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/01/hw-101-uart/">embarcados.com.br</a></span>
    </div>
    <p>Understand that this signal is a voltage (it's not the most accurate way to say it... but it's commonly referred to as "voltage") that sends information. Note that at time x, the signal is at 5V, at a certain moment it reaches 3.29V, and after some more time, it's at 4.73V. I really don't know at which moment it reaches, that's the main issue! An analog signal has various values in the same communication.</p>
    <p>
        The analog signal is extremely useful in cases where we need sensors like: temperature, distance, or even to control device power. This is a power controller I assembled, don't dwell on the operation or voltage, just understand that the analog signal does not have an exact value:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/analogico.png" alt="Image description">
    </div>  
    <p class="subtopic"><strong>Digital Signals</strong></p>
    <p>
        Digital signals are represented by binary numbers. This means that a digital signal has only 2 states: on or off, 0 or 1. See a Digital Signal wave:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/onda_digital.png"> 
        <span class="link"><a href="https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/01/hw-101-uart/">embarcados.com.br</a></div>
    <p>
        Note that indirectly we have two different voltages and two distinct representations. 0V is represented by the value 0 (logical state: off), while 5V is represented by the value 1 (logical state: on).
        <br>A digital signal will ALWAYS be 0 or 1 (well, let's not get into quantum computing). It's possible that the logical state "1" (on) is represented by 3.3V or 5V, but still, we have only the values 0 and 1. This is easy to understand; for example, think of a light bulb: can it be in two logical states at the same time? "Half on"? No. It will be in state 0 (off) or state 1 (on).
        <br>There are many related concepts, such as logic gates and pull-down resistors, among others, but, as mentioned earlier, these topics are not the focus of this context.
    </p>
    <p class="topic"><strong>Summary of UART/Serial Protocol</strong></p>
    <p>
        <span class="link"><a href="https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/01/hw-101-uart/">riverloopsecurity</a></span> gave an interesting definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        "It's easy to think of serial communication like Morse Code. In Morse Code, there are only two signals that can be sent - a short beep or a long beep. By combining short and long beeps in a specific order, they can be understood as letters and words."
    </p>

        <span class="link"><a href="https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/01/hw-101-uart/">riverloopsecurity.com</a></span>
    </div>
    <p>
    <p>
        Computers rely on a communication logic that involves the use of different levels of electrical voltage to represent digital information. This technique allows electronic devices to transmit data reliably.
        <br><br>In the context of digital logic, it is common for a higher voltage level, such as 3.3V or 5V, to be interpreted as the logical value "1", while a lower voltage level, usually 0V, is interpreted as the logical value "0". This is the basis of encoding digital information in electronics.
        <br><br>However, it is important to understand the concept of pull-down resistors. When a switch or device is turned off, it does not necessarily send 0V, but it might not send any electrical signal, which is represented as "Ã˜V" (null voltage) or simply the absence of a logical level. To avoid confusion in interpretation, a pull-down resistor is used, which is an electronic component connected between the input/output point and ground (0V). This ensures that when the switch or device is turned off, the voltage is effectively pulled to 0V, ensuring that the system correctly recognizes the logical value "0". When the switch or device is triggered, the voltage can reach higher levels, such as 5V or 3.3V, depending on the application.
        <br><br>For communication using the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) protocol, pins designated as TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) are used. This protocol is widely used in serial communication between devices, where data is transmitted sequentially, one bit at a time. The TX pin is used to transmit data, while the RX pin is used to receive data. This serial communication is essential in a variety of applications, such as microcontrollers, sensors, communication modules, and other electronic devices, enabling efficient exchange of digital information between them.

    <p class="topic"><strong>Finding TX and RX</strong></p>
    <p>
        Usually, TX and RX are accompanied by two other terminals: VCC and GND.<br>First, let's disassemble the equipment and get an overview of the target:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/roteador-open.png"> 
    </div>
    <p>
        We need to find 4 connection points, usually four nearby terminals, the famous "4 little holes", which are VCC, GND, TX, and RX. <strong>There is no standard order</strong>; I used a multimeter to identify which terminal is GND, VCC, TX, and RX. Note that in the router used, there was already a soldered bus.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/txrx.png"> 
    </div>
    <p class="Subtopic"><strong>Locating GND</strong></p>
    <p>The first terminal we need to identify is GND because with it, we can find VCC and Tx. <br>To identify GND, I used the continuity test mode of the multimeter. Do you agree that more than one point of the router is connected to GND, correct? Following this logic, I will connect one probe to the router's GND input and test each terminal until one of them beeps, indicating that there was contact between the two probe points.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/gnd.gif"> The second terminal is GND
    </div>
    <p class="Subtopic"><strong>Locating VCC</strong></p>
    <p>Finding VCC is extremely simple. With the router turned on, just find the terminal that, when one probe is connected to GND, will have a <strong>STABLE</strong> 3.3V or 5V.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/medicao-vcc.png"> The first terminal is VCC
    </div>
    <p class="Subtopic"><strong>Locating Tx</strong></p>
    <p>As I mentioned, Tx stands for transmit, and signals are sent via electrical pulses (3.3V in this case, as confirmed during the VCC measurement). When we turn on the router, during the first 10 ~ 20 seconds, Tx needs to vary due to the pulses (data - a series of 0s and 1s) being transmitted.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/tx.gif"> The third terminal is Tx
    </div>
    <p class="Subtopic"><strong>Locating Rx</strong></p>
    <p>Is it really necessary? Only one terminal is left. If you want to confirm, theoretically, it shouldn't send any data; consequently, its voltage should be stable. While there might be slight fluctuations, they are nothing compared to the pulsations of Tx.<br>The last terminal is Rx.</p>
    <p class="topic"><strong>Making the Connections</strong></p>
    <p>
        We have identified all the terminals of the router's UART serial output:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/terminais.png"> 
    </div>
    <p>
        To obtain the shell, I will be using an FT232. I was recommended this board by <span class="link"><a href="https://lucasteske.dev/">Lucas Teske</a></span>. To identify its outputs, you can search for information online:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/ft232-pin-out.png"> 
    </div>
    <p>
        Right. We need to understand how to make the connection between the FT232 and the serial outputs we found. It might seem obvious, but it's not always intuitive. <strong>Tx -> Rx</strong> and <strong>Rx -> Tx</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/ft232.png"> The Hardware Hacking Handbook
    </div>
    <p>
        The reason for this connection is extremely straightforward. Once the <strong>Transmitter</strong> of the router sends data, the <strong>Receiver</strong> of the FT232 must pick it up. When the <strong>Transmitter</strong> of the FT232 sends data, the <strong>Receiver</strong> of the router must receive it. This image explains it precisely:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/uart_transmissao.png"> https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/uart-a-hardware-communication-protocol.html
    </div>
    <p>
        Now that we understand how to make the connections, linking the Tx, Rx, and VCC pins of the FT232 with their counterparts on our target device, let's move on to the practical part. Take a look at how I made the connections:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/conexao.jpg"> 
    </div>
    </p>
    <p class="topic"> <strong>Receiving the Connection</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To establish the connection, I used <span class="link"><a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a></span>. I plugged in the FT232 into my machine and identified its port (COM1, COM2, COM3...):
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src= https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/putty.png>
    </div>
    <p>    
        Before we receive the connection, we need to understand one more concept: the <strong>Baud Rates</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="Subtopic"><strong>Baud Rates</strong></p>
    <p>
        I mentioned a phrase that said, "a short beep or a long beep. By combining short and long beeps in a specific order, they can be understood as letters and words." <br>This is true, but following this analogy, how long does a short beep last? And a long beep? The first step is to remember that in digital communication systems, a "byte" is a data unit consisting of <strong>8 bits</strong>.<br><br>Data transmission speed is measured in <strong>baud rates</strong>, which represent the number of signals or symbols transmitted per second. One "baud" usually equals a single signal or signal transition per second.
        <br><br>For example, if you are in a system with a baud rate of 9600 bps (bauds per second) and you are transmitting an 8-bit byte, the duration of one byte would be:
    </p>
    <div class="codehilite">
        <pre><code>
            Duration of one byte (seconds) = Size of the byte (in bits) / Baud rate (bauds)
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        <br>For example, if you are in a system with a baud rate of 9600 bps and you are transmitting an 8-bit byte, the duration of one byte would be:
        <br>Duration of one byte (seconds) = 8 bits / 9600 bauds = 0.0008333 seconds (or about 833 microseconds)
        <br>Therefore, in a system with a baud rate of 9600 bps, a "byte" would take approximately 833 microseconds to be transmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The product manufacturer can define any speed they want, but there are standard speeds that are more commonly used:
    </p>
    <div class="codehilite">
        <pre><code>
            110 300 600 1200 2400 4800 9600 14400 19200 38400 57600 115200 128000 256000
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here's an example of a connection with the wrong speed:
    </p>
    <div class="gif-container">
        <img src= https://gutierre0x80.github.io/Itens/velocidade-errada.png>
    </div>
    <p>
        So far, I have manually tested these speeds and luckily, I got it right in a few attempts. However, there are ways for you to discover this speed, such as using an oscilloscope.
